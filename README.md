# Hey! I'm Naman ðŸ‘‹

**Go Backend Engineer** crafting high-performance systems from India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³

## About Me

I'm a backend engineer who loves building robust, scalable systems with Go. There's something deeply satisfying about writing clean, efficient code that can handle thousands of requests without breaking a sweat. When I'm not optimizing APIs or diving into concurrency patterns, you'll find me exploring new ways to make software faster and more reliable.

```go
type Developer struct {
    Name        string
    Role        string
    Location    string
    Passion     string
    DailyDriver []string
}

me := Developer{
    Name:        "Naman Sharma",
    Role:        "Go Backend Engineer",
    Location:    "India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³",
    Passion:     "Building systems that scale beautifully",
    DailyDriver: []string{"Go", "Docker", "gRPC", "PostgreSQL"},
}
```

## What I Work With

**Core:** Go, gRPC, REST APIs, Microservices  
**Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis  
**Infrastructure:** Docker, Kubernetes, Linux  
**Frontend:** React.js, JavaScript (when needed)  
**Tools:** Git, VS Code, Postman, Prometheus

## Currently Exploring

- Advanced Go concurrency patterns
- Distributed systems design
- Cloud-native architectures
- Performance optimization techniques
