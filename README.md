## 🎯 What I Do

I turn coffee into **fast, reliable backend systems** that actually work under pressure. My days are spent writing Go code, optimizing databases, and making sure everything stays up when it matters most.

When I'm not debugging production issues, you'll find me diving deep into distributed systems or tinkering with the latest DevOps tools.

## 🛠️ My Toolkit

**Core Stack**
- **Go** - My language of choice for building robust backends
- **PostgreSQL & MongoDB** - For when data needs a home
- **GORM** - Go Object-Relational Mapping library 

**Infrastructure & DevOps**
- **Docker & Kubernetes** - Containerize and Orchestrate all the things
- **Linux** -  first language for devops
- **Prometheus & Grafana** - Keeping an eye on what matters through a good UI

**Also Comfortable With**
- **React.js & JavaScript** - when i want clean and good ui based apps (when their is none in the team/group who want's to do then i do frontend but have done very well in this domain in 1st year).
- **Git, VS Code, Postman** - some basics things that we developer require like everyone else i know them also.
