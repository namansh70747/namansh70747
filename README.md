## 🎯 What I Do

I turn coffee into **fast, reliable backend systems** that actually work under pressure. My days are spent writing Go code, optimizing databases, and making sure everything stays up when it matters most.

When I'm not debugging production issues, you'll find me diving deep into distributed systems or tinkering with the latest DevOps tools.

## 🛠️ My Toolkit

**Core Stack**
- **Go** - My language of choice for building robust backends
- **PostgreSQL & MongoDB** - For when data needs a home
- **Redis** - Because caching makes everything faster

**Infrastructure & DevOps**
- **Docker & Kubernetes** - Containerizing all the things
- **Linux** - My daily driver
- **Prometheus & Grafana** - Keeping an eye on what matters

**Also Comfortable With**
- **React.js & JavaScript** - For when I venture to the frontend
- **Git, VS Code, Postman** - The usual suspects
