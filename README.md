I’m a backend engineer who enjoys turning ideas into **fast, reliable, and scalable systems**.
I spend most of my time writing Go, working with databases, and making sure things don’t break under load 🚀.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually learning about distributed systems, performance tuning, or exploring the next cool DevOps tool.
